## Proposal 2: NextDestination- Assessing & forecasting the popularity of travel destinations

### 1. Introduction to the problem statement
A web application analyzes the popularity of travel destinations and uses machine learning to predict the next visitor bloom.

### 2. Abstract (rough draft)
COVID-19 has taken a huge toll on the tourism industry due to travel restrictions and public health concerns. As COVID vaccination rates continue to increase, more and more people are willing to travel after spending a year at home.

But to what extent has tourism recovered? What is the volume of visitors that local businesses can expect? And what if there are some tourists who want to make a trip but still concern about the crowd? All these problems can be solved by this application.

In this web application, we will analyze tourist data to obtain destination popularity trends after the outbreak of COVID to better serve tourism investors as well as local businesses. Additionally, we will provide recommendations for less crowded destinations. For selected destinations, we can further provide predict trends over time.

### 3. Approach

- Data preprocessing and modeling

### 4. Persona
- Tourism investors 
- Businesses in travel destination
